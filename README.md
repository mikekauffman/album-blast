Album Blast!
============

This app was created by Mike Kauffman. This concept of this app was to develop a basic understanding of the Spotify API through making a fun and visual application that uses multiple aspects of the API.

Functionality: User searches for an artist, band name, album name, or song name, and a list of spotify player widgets is displayed for all relevant results of the search.

Development
===========

The most updated version of the app can be found in production here:
